<a id="example-license"></a>
### EXAMPLE: choose a license

**Status:** done

**Note:** Resolved by adding LICENSE.md.

**Opened:** 2026-09-22


<a id="subrepo-push-untested"></a>
### git subrepo push has never been exercised

**Status:** open

**Note:** Only clone/pull have been battle-tested against tad-engine. We never push local .tad/ changes upstream by design, but the command path itself is unverified.

**Opened:** 2026-09-22


<a id="pre-pinning-releases-unpinned"></a>
### tad-engine v1.0.0 and v1.0.1 have no dist/vX.Y.Z tag

**Status:** open

**Note:** The dist-tagging fix only applies going forward; those two releases predate it and stay reachable only via the moving dist branch.

**Opened:** 2026-09-22


<a id="render-determinism-untested-multicore"></a>
### render.py determinism has only been verified for dc.py, not render.py itself

**Status:** open

**Note:** dc.py was stress-tested at 300k rows on a real multi-core GitHub runner; render.py (both the generic one and this repo's custom one) has not had the same treatment.

**Opened:** 2026-09-22


<a id="git-subrepo-dependency-risk"></a>
### git-subrepo is a slow-moving third-party dependency

**Status:** open

**Note:** Last tagged release July 2024 despite ongoing commits, and 201 open issues at last check. A standing risk to monitor, not an active problem.
